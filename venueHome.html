                            develop the former Campsall Club.&nbsp; Due to Covid 19 we are
                            unable to carry out our normal Public Consultation process and
                            have instead prepared an online consultation portal to allow
                            feedback &amp; dialogue with local stakeholders.
                            <br />
                            <br />This portal will be open for a period of two weeks and will
                            close on the 14th June 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;
