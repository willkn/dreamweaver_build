                                    We are one of the largest housing associations in the North of
                                    England, managing over 36,000 homes across Yorkshire and

                                    money we make is invested back into the company for the
                                    benefit of our residents and local communities. In addition to
                                    providing quality homes to rent, we also build and manage
                                    homes for sale through the Shared Ownership scheme.
                                    Additionally we provide sheltered accommodation and extra care
                                    schemes. Not only do we provide homes, but through our
                                    charity, Newground Together, we fund a variety of voluntary
                                    and community projects, groups to help improve life and
                                    opportunities to work for local people. You can find out more
